Heart Disease Analysis – Power BI Dashboard Project

This project focuses on analyzing heart disease trends by building an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard. The dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, relationships were modeled, and multiple DAX measures were created to enhance analysis. The dashboard includes KPIs, charts, slicers, and drill-down visuals to examine correlations between health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and heart disease outcomes.
